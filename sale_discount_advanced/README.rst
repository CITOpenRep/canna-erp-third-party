======================
Sale Discount Advanced
======================

This module allows to define discount policies based upon order or order line values.

This concept is different from the standard Odoo pricelist concept which allows to define price discount based
upon ordered quantities on a per sale order line (hence without consideration of total order value).

Installation
============

There is no specific installation procedure for this module.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to Sales > Configuration > Discounts

  to create your discount policies.

* Go to Sales > Sales > Customers

  to add the default Sale Discounts to your Customer records.

* Go to Settings > Users

  We recommend to set the 'Discount on lines' option in the 'Technical Settings'.

Usage
=====

Once the disoounts are configured, the discount policies will be applied automatically
to the order lines based upon the selected customer.

You can also manually add extra discount policies on the order or the order lines.

Discounts can be marked as exclusive via the 'Exclusive' checkbox on the discount object.
If your conditions are met for multiple discounts, then only
the first exclusive discount (based on sequence) will be set on the order line.

Known issues
============

There no known issues at this point in time.

Roadmap
=======

Addition or demo data and unit tests.
