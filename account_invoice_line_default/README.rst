=====================
Invoice Line defaults
=====================

This module facilitates the encoding of Invoices lines: 

- The 'Account' field is initialised from the default invoice account fields on the partner records.
- A 'Description' field is added to the main page of the Invoice form
  and the Invoice Line label fields are initialised from this field.
