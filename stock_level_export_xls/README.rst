========================
Stock Level Excel export
========================

This module adds an Excel export of the Stock Levels at a specified date.

The output of this module is compatible with the format of the 'stock_level_import' module.
The combination of these two modules (available from apps.odoo.com) gives a simple yet powerful
tool for inventory updates.

Usage
=====

- Via Inventory menu

Select Inventory Reporting/Stock Level Excel export.

- Via Product records

Select a number of products in a product record list view and execute the 'Stock Level Excel export' option of the 'Action' menu
to export the stock levels of the selected set of products.
